How do you explain the architecture of your most favorite or challenging project? Do you draw all these nice squares and circles on a board (or perhaps, MS Paint?) and connect them with the fancy lines and arrows? Finally, you would add the labels here and there - it looks just great! Then you are asked to zoom into a particular area, and everything becomes a mess. The more you need to draw, the messier it becomes.

[C4 Model](https://c4model.com/) is to the rescue. This approach provides a top-down way to see the architecture from four perspectives. You show the system from the most abstract `Context` diagram to the most detailed `Code` diagram. Learn more about the C4 architectural approach on [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C4_model). 

Recently I've struggled to explain the architecture during the Systems Design interview. Here I will be using one of my past projects to describe the Parking System according to the C4 Model architectural approach.

## Final thoughts

I like the idea of C4 Model and use it successfully with my customers. It's got me thinking about using the C4 Model for Systems Design. The C4 Model offers an elegant approach to decomposing a system and providing different perspectives.
